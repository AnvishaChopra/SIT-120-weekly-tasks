<td><font color="white" size=4>This all started in 2021 when a random idea of an India girl
to pursue her higher studies in Australia took over her. With absolutely no 
clue what to do next she started searching for Youtube videos to find her way
around. The only thing that she was sure about was the support from her parents. 
They were there for her, come what may! </font><br>

<h2><b><font color="blue" size=5>  Which university? Which course? Can she 
get a 100% scholarship? </font></b></h2><br>
<font color="white" size=4> She searched for days, followed by weeks. But it simply 
seemed like a never ending task. But she was not gonna give up that easily.By the 
end of month two she got her answer. It was gonna be none other than 
<font size=5 color="blue"> <b><i>Deakin University.</i></b> </font>

<p><div>Wohhhooooooooo she did her victoy dance. Time for task two now.
Which course? That wasn't so tough for her to decide. Wanna know why???
Read her views below on her </font> <font color="Blue" size=4> vision, execution 
plan, which path she wanted to take to complete her aim. </div> </p><br>

<font color="white" size=4><div> For people without special needs Artificial intelligence and 
integrated technologies can make things easier but for people with such
special needs it can make things possible. Her vision was to contribute
to the field of special education for people with special needs with
the help of AI and integrated concepts. She had always believed that such
people are like beautiful butterflies but with broken wings and need some
extra help to spread them again.
With the knowledge of such modern technologies, She as an individual can 
prove to be an asset that would be able to provide help so that
they are able spread their wings once more. Furthermore, She intended
to expand her realm and be a help to other communities, being a help 
to humanity at large.<br>
By applying for the Bachelors of information Technology course at Deakin
University She would get an edge over the others by being a part
of a work integrating environment along with the chance to collaborate with
like-minded peers and work on projects, which would not only 
strengthen my theoretical concepts but also give a life to it my putting it to
practical use.
According to her research one of the plus points of the University is also that it has a Disability resource center (DRC) with its 
disability, access and inclusion plan. In her capacity as a Deakin student she plans to engage with this faculty and use it as an idea
generator for my projects related to my vision. This way she would be able to integrate the concepts that are being taught at the university
and put it to practical use. This would help her to work on her vision and not simply wait for her degree to get completed to start the execution of her future plans.I
think you got your answer now! :) I know she is amazing right!!</div></font>
